## Description
TeleRoulette is an installation exploring the cultural impact of the vast archive of user submitted video content that is [YouTube](www.youtube.com). It also references the increasingly curated content we receive online as smarter data mining techniques begin to suggest content to us and guide our journey through the world wide web. Even without content suggestions, our individual searching patterns only ever take us down particular paths, we are limited by the kinds of keywords we generate and the interests that lead us there. TeleRoulette is an attempt to disrupt our predefined consumption patterns and rocket us into the dizzying, multicultural sprawl of video content that is available on-line, dressing up the experience with an element of retro-nostalgia and gameshow pizzaz.

The motivation for TeleRoulette is to monitor the pulse of the web and capture the zeitgeist of the Internet through a stream of random videos. The result â€“ different every time, but most likely intriguing, then dull, then disturbing, then really really funny.

The diversity and volume of visual information gathered is filtered through a familiar "old" technology, the TV set, which is fast becoming obsolete as a Radio Frequency (RF) content provider. Employing a television and not simply a web browser is a form of media archaeology and helps to ground and contextualise the changes in media consumption we have been subject to since the advent of Internet streaming.

Turn the TV on and immediately be transfixed by the endless slide-show of random, weird or banal video clips, seamlessly pre-loaded to ensure smooth transitions.

We are deluged with options and configuration possibilities these days. Tele-roulette is a solution to this. Just sink onto the couch and switch on the box.

**Installation setup**
The installation version of this project would consist of two elements:

**Solid State Streaming**
Firstly a standalone reworked retro transistor TV would be placed on a plinth, with only a power cable leading from it. This would be playing endless random YouTube videos. Inside the TV would be a Raspberry Pi with a wireless USB dongle attached as well as a composite video to RF converter, enabling the device to play video content. Optionally the TV dial might be able to switch channels or change videos. From the outside, it would appear to be a normal TV with no internet connectivity visible.

**The TeleRoulette**
A large wall of old Cathode Ray TVs looms above gallery viewers. In front of this edifice is a large spinnnable wheel labelled with 20-30 different words. Once the wheel has been spun, as it slows down it will eventually settle on a word, which is then automatically triggers a YouTube search using that word as a query term. Some of the words are labelled "random", and if these words are selected the search result returns a random video. Once a video has been selected, either randomly or through a search term, the TV wall lights us as each screen plays that same video.
