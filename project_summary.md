## Description
The Tele-roulette is a reworked retro transistor TV that broadcasts a constant stream of random videos plucked off the Internet, principally from Youtube.com and Vimeo.com

Search engines are determining our sources of information, guiding us towards what they believe we want through increasingly complex heuristics. As a result we are fed only a small slice of the possibilities the Internet has to offer. 

The motivation for Tele-Roulette is to monitor the pulse of the web and capture the zeitgeist of the Internet through a stream of random videos.

The result â€“ different every time, but most likely intriguing, then dull, then disturbing, then really really funny.

The diversity and volume of visual information gathered is filtered through a familiar "old" technology, the TV set, which is fast becoming obsolete as a Radio Frequency (RF) content provider. Employing a television and not simply a web browser helps to ground and contextualise the changes in media consumption we have been subject to since the advent of Internet streaming.

Turn the TV on, switch to a favourite channel, and immediately be transfixed by the endless slide-show of random, weird or banal video clips, seamlessly pre-loaded to ensure smooth transitions.

We are deluged with options and configuration possibilities these days. Tele-roulette is a solution to this. Just sink onto the couch and switch on the box.
