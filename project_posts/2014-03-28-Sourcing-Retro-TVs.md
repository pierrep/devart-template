One of the challenges for this project will be to scour the earth for the best and finest retro televisions. The kitsch and outdated aesthetic of these devices is key to the project. Simply playing back YouTube clips on a old TV is not going to be enough to trigger a shift in media context. These TVs are going to need to look archaic, and cute to boot. The impact will come from seeing something strangely modern (like a minecraft walkthrough) being played back on a screen that would have been built by engineers long before the Internet came into existence.

A brief search on-line turned up this photo. Perhaps I'll need to make a trip to Japan, I'm willing to bet they have some very lovely old TVs:
