As a kid I used to get this sensation on sunny days that somewhere unbeknownst to me someone was having the time of their life and I was missing out.

The motivation for this project is the sensation that somewhere in the world something weird or wonderful or mundane is happening at any instant.

This project is an attempt to capture those fleeting moments, from the new archive of human existance, YouTube.

I've been collecting old analogue TV's for a while in the hope of bringing them to life, and finally I've found a reason.

However, before I move onto the hardware component of this project, I need to have a proof of concept of the software needed to drive this piece.

Inspiration or at least the knowledge that this sort of thing was possible came to me from the following projects:

[Minitube](http://flavio.tordini.org/minitube "Minitube")
