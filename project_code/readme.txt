There are three folders here - two experimental ones for the Raspberry Pi and one desktop version.

In all versions hitting the spacebar gets the next random video.

These can be built using the latest version of openFrameworks 0.8.0
The only other dependencies are the youtube-dl command line program (rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/â€Ž) and GStreamer (for playing videos streams through the ofVideoPlayer).

The software was tested on Ubuntu Linux version 12.04 and above.
